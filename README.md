## Overview

The "House Price Prediction" notebook showcases how to use machine learning to estimate house prices. By analyzing historical data on house sales and employing various modeling techniques, the notebook aims to build a model that can predict the price of a house given certain features. This involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Data

The dataset used in this notebook includes information about various houses and their sale prices. The key features in the dataset are:

- `Id`: Unique identifier for each house
- `MSSubClass`: The type of dwelling
- `LotFrontage`: Linear feet of street connected to property
- `LotArea`: Lot size in square feet
- `OverallQual`: Overall material and finish quality
- `OverallCond`: Overall condition rating
- `YearBuilt`: Original construction year
- `YearRemodAdd`: Remodel year
- `GrLivArea`: Above ground living area in square feet
- `BsmtFullBath`: Number of basement full bathrooms
- `FullBath`: Number of full bathrooms
- `HalfBath`: Number of half bathrooms
- `BedroomAbvGr`: Number of bedrooms above grade
- `TotRmsAbvGrd`: Total number of rooms above grade
- `Fireplaces`: Number of fireplaces
- `GarageCars`: Size of garage in car capacity
- `GarageArea`: Size of garage in square feet
- `SalePrice`: Sale price of the house (target variable)

## Dependencies

The notebook requires the following Python packages:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn 
```

## Notebook Structure

The Jupyter Notebook is organized into the following sections:

1. **Introduction**: Overview of the project and goals.
2. **Data Loading**: Importing and inspecting the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and analyzing data to uncover patterns and relationships that may help in predicting house prices.
5. **Feature Engineering**: Creating and selecting features that will be used for training the model.
6. **Model Building**:
   - **Splitting Data**: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - **Training the Model**: Applying machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, random forest and stacking) to train the model.
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters to improve performance.
7. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model’s performance using metrics such as R² score and Cross validation.
8. **Results**: Presenting and interpreting the results, including model predictions and performance metrics.
9. **Conclusion**: Summarizing findings and suggesting potential improvements or next steps.
